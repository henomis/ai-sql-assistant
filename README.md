This is a simple AI SQL query builder helper written in GO. It uses OpenAI API to generate a plausible SQL query from a given question. Generated query is executed and results are displayed. And, if you provide a plot question, it will generate a plot for you.

It only supports MySQL and SQLite for now. This project is powered by [LinGoose](https://github.com/henomis/lingoose) ü™ø
